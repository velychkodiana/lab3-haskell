Haskell is a purely functional programming language. In Haskell, a function always produces the same output value given the same input, and it doesn’t have side effects like modifying global state or printing to the screen directly. This allows you to reason about programs more easily and makes them safer and more predictable. Haskell’s type system helps catch many errors at compile time, ensuring that your programs behave consistently. Although functional programming may seem unfamiliar if you're used to imperative languages, once you get used to thinking in functions, you will find Haskell expressive, elegant, and powerful.
